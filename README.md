About Me:\
I am a former Navy Nuke Electrician's Mate (Submarines) - this is one of, if not the most acidemically rigorous training program the US military has to offer, with a high drop-out rate even among the brightest individuals in the Navy; to have been a Nuke is a difficult endeavor which I am proud to have acheived, and I mention it here because it is indeed an acheivement which speaks for itself to those acquainted with what it means.\
I attended college briefly as a dual-enrolled high school student and learned HTML/CSS many years ago, as well as basic fundamentals of computer programming before joining the Navy as a Nuke.\
Afterwards, I became a calibration technician for Yokogawa Corporation of America, who manufactures precision electronic measurementation instruments; where I used calibration software and manual procedures to calibrate and adjust those instruments.\
While doing this job, I endeavored to teach myself to code (more/ again) using the same environment the company used for the calibration software, Microsoft Visual Basics for Applications running in Excel workbooks, to automate some of the tasks that were still manual for calibrating several machines.\
doing this taught me MS VBA and got me well acquainted with functional programming, as well as with HP's GPIB (General Purpose Interface Bus) library to talk to the machines involved.\
after covid, I got a job doing industrial maintenance, and decided to go to college to pursue IT and programming in general, as I have thoroughly enjoyed what programming I got to do in the past, even without much formal training in the field.\
In college, I took classes covering networking, C#, Java, databases and SQL, digital PLDs like FPGA's et al, project management, and more; and have so far acheived an AS in Computer Information Technology with honors, and am currently working towards a BS in IT as well.\\\
